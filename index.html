							<a href="images/Mismatch-Over-Time.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Puerto Rico.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Improving Energy Forecasting in Puerto Rico’s Power Grid</h3>
							<p class="image-caption">Puerto Rico’s power grid faces significant mismatches between energy generation and capacity, impacting reliability
                                and efficiency as the island transitions to renewable energy. Using data from the <a href="https://pr100.gov/">PR100 Project</a>, this 
                                analysis visualizes imbalances across energy sources like solar, wind, diesel, and natural gas. Utility and distributed photovoltaics 
                                (large and small-scale solar panels) often face the largest mismatches, highlighting the need for better storage solutions. Diesel is
                                proven to be a reliable fuel source, while natural gas turbines occasionally overproduce energy, leading to inefficiencies. Addressing these 
                                challenges through improved forecasting and optimization can ensure a more sustainable, resilient energy future. Connect with me on

                                transformation!</p>

						<article class="col-12 work-item">
							<a href="images/GDP Per Capita - Renewable Electricity.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Renewable Electricity.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Renewable Electricity Output by Country</h3>
							<p class="image-caption">This project explores the relationship between renewable energy use and economic wealth in G20 countries, uncovering a 
                                weak but statistically significant correlation between renewable electricity output and GDP per capita. Data from 
                                <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-electricity-renewables">Our World in Data</a> and the 
                                <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a> reveals that while wealthy nations like Luxembourg and Denmark 
                                lead in both metrics, others like South Korea and Saudi Arabia remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels despite their high GDP. Meanwhile, 
                                countries like Brazil highlight unique challenges, with high renewable energy use but low GDP per capita. These findings emphasize the need 
                                for balanced strategies that combine renewable energy adoption with broader economic and infrastructural policies. Let’s rethink how energy 
                                policies drive growth—connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-ewell-679b84236/">LinkedIn</a> to share insights and 
                                collaborate on sustainable development strategies!</p>

						<!-- Third project -->
						<article class="col-12 work-item">
							<a href="images/Fraud Dashboard.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Fraud Detection IMG.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Fraud Detection System</h3>
							<p class="image-caption">This project leverages a fraud detection system to analyze and track fraudulent transactions, comparing 
                                them against legitimate ones in terms of volume, timing, and amounts. Using an artificially generated dataset processed with 
                                SQL, the analysis reveals trends such as a spike in fraudulent activity around March, followed by a decline in April, and 
                                highlights that fraudulent transactions account for 3.1% of total transactions. High-risk fraud cases often involve larger 
                                transaction amounts ($8,000+), emphasizing the need for targeted prevention strategies. Dashboards like these enable financial 
                                institutions to identify fraud patterns, enhance detection methods, and reduce financial losses. Connect with me on 
                                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-ewell-679b84236/">LinkedIn</a> to share insights or collaborate on fraud prevention 
                                analytics!</p>

						<!-- Fourth project -->
						<article class="col-12 work-item">
							<a href="images/Churn Boxplots.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Customer Churn Image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Customer Churn Analysis</h3>
							<p class="image-caption">This project examines customer churn in the telecom industry by analyzing key factors such as bandwidth usage, 
                                monthly charges, and tenure to uncover patterns behind customer departures. Customers who don’t churn tend to use more bandwidth, 
                                pay lower monthly charges, and have significantly longer tenures. These findings highlight the importance of offering competitive 
                                pricing and fostering long-term customer relationships to reduce churn rates. The dataset, generated from a fictional telecom company, 
                                was cleaned and analyzed using Python as part of a school curriculum. Connect with me on 
                                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-ewell-679b84236/">LinkedIn</a> to discuss insights or strategies for customer retention!</p>

						<article class="col-12 work-item">
							<a href="images/Recruitment Dashboard White BG.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Data Driven Recruitment Process in Action.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Data-Driven Recruitment</h3>
							<p class="image-caption">
								This project leverages data to address recruitment challenges faced by hiring managers, providing a comparative analysis of recruitment 
                                sources across key metrics like candidate conversion, cost per hire, quality of hire, and time to hire. Employee referrals excel with the 
                                highest candidate conversion rate and shortest time to hire, while Indeed yields lower quality hires on average. Recruitment agencies, 
                                despite having the highest cost per hire and longest hiring time, offer competitive candidate quality. Using artificially generated data 
                                processed in Excel and Power Query, these findings empower hiring managers to optimize recruitment strategies for cost-effective and efficient 
                                hiring processes. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-ewell-679b84236/">LinkedIn</a> to discuss how data can 
                                transform recruitment strategies!</p>
